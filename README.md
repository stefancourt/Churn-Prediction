## 🌐 Overview

A python notebook containing different prediciton techniques in order to determine the outcome that a customer will churn their bank account. A csv file is present within this folder that contains the information on specific attributes for each user. many graphs are present after running the application visualising different correlations between data and different results for the various techniques used.

## 🚀 Running the Application

To run the application simply make sure the dependencies are installed, if they are not you should install these by running the top cell in the notebook. You should then run the cells in a top down manner to ensure that the program runs correctly and can use certain outputs already generated. Upon completion of running all the cells, many graphs should be present showing the effectiveness of the different prediction techniques.

## 📦 Requirements

The following libraries and packages are required to run the application. These are downloaded within the notebook.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/)
